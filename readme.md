Easy to use backup manager for Laravel.

**Features**
- Quick installation
- Integration with Laravels queue and filesystem
- Support for multiple Laravel versions (`5.1 => 5.5`)
- Each table is stored in it's own file

## Installation

### Composer
```
composer require mrtnsn/backup-manager
```

### Provider
Add the service provider to `providers` in `config/app.php` so that it's registered
in your Laravel application.

```
Mrtnsn\BackupManager\BackupManagerProvider::class,
```

### Publish
If you need to change the default config you have to publish the config file.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mrtnsn\BackupManager\BackupManagerProvider"
```

## Usage

### Commands
The package exposes two artisan commands, one for `export` and one for `import`.

#### Export
Export will use your current credentials and config to export the database
to your desired location.

This command gives no feedback since it's meant to be run from the scheduler.
This prevent filling up log files with unnecessary data.

The command can be execute manually with a custom tag, this can be usefull if multiple developers
are testing different databases on a staging server and need to quickly change between them.

##### Running it from schedule (app/Console/Kernel.php)
```php
$schedule->command('backup-manager:export')
    ->daily();
```

##### Running it manually
```
php artisan backup-manager:export
```

##### Running it manually with custom tag
```
php artisan backup-manager:export --tag=newFeature
```

#### Import
Import will use your current credentials and config to import a selected backup.

This command is built to be run manually as it needs feedback to get the right backup.

You get to choose which `subFolder` and which `version` you want to restore.
After this is selected it will loop through all files matching those parameteres
and drop the table before importing it again.

This will cause minimal downtime as it only affects one table at a time.

##### Running it manually
```
php artisan backup-manager:import
```
